# Capstone_AdventureGame
CS 467 group project repository, we are implementing a text based adventure game with natural language processing similar to Zork. Members include: Nicole Olson, Leslie Shen and Coby Lee Hartman 

To play:
Put playgame1.py in the current working directory.
The Game_Engine, Game_Files, and Parser directories should be subdirectories in the current working directory.
In the current working directory, run python3 playgame1.py on an OSU flip server.
