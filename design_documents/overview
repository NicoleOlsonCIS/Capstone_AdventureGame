From Project Proposal: 

  User runs the program and starts up the game on the command line
    
  User will see a welcome message and be prompted to start a new game or load a saved game, e.g. with some kind of menu options or by entering “new” or “load” at prompt; any important instructions to the user can be displayed at this point as well

  User will be able to start gameplay and see introductory narrative text, if any (e.g. description of setting/character/backstory/explanation of events leading up to the current point and why the character is in this dungeon)

  User will see current room/feature/item descriptions, and exit descriptions with directions

  User will be able to see event descriptions, if any occur while in a room

  User will be able to interact with the game by entering actions and objects and seeing the results of their actions
  
  User will be able to interact with rooms/features/items by:

    Entering/leaving rooms & seeing relevant descriptions
    Examining features and items & seeing relevant descriptions
    Picking up and dropping objects & receiving appropriate confirmation
    Using items to perform some action & seeing relevant confirmation/description

  User will receive appropriate feedback if the game is unable to perform a desired action (e.g. it doesn’t make sense linguistically) or an action is impossible in-game

  User will be able to enter “help” to view a list of supported verbs

  User will be able to enter “inventory” to see the contents of their inventory
  
  User will be able to save a game, which should then show up in their saves and be available for loading; user sees appropriate confirmation/prompting/feedback throughout

  User will be able to quit the game; user should be asked if they want to save before quitting
