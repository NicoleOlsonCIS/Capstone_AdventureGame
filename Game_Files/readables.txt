faded blue book###You flip to the first pages of the book:

“Prior study of Wiesmannian geometry is not assumed, as my decades of research and teaching caused me to become dissatisfied with the historic approach to hatch theory, which is predicated upon the assumption that matter may be understood in geometric terms, and that it would be useful to do so. 

Of course, Janssen’s emphasis on the notion of space-time as a Wiesmannian manifold must influence any discussion of the theory he helped create. However, I believe the limitations of this perspective are at risk of obstructing our ready synthesis of the theories of gravitation and elementary particles…”

hefty black book###You check the cover and see the title:

~A First Course in Hatch Theory~

You decide against reading, and instead flip idly through the entire book. You notice writing in the margins of several pages, notes hastily scrawled in black ink.

Disjointed and incoherent, the writing meanders through the margins, stopping and starting without rhyme or reason. You read the fragments, wondering what they mean:

“...proximity distortion...Felton’s field??? ...overlaps problematic, even minor ones destructive to reality...thinning can cause micro-hatches, micro-exposure to interstices?...which seep in and erode the substance of the contaminated sphere...”

dull reddish book###You check the cover and see the title:

~Hatch Mechanics and Interstices~

You flip quickly through the entire book from cover to cover. You find that the final page is covered in scribbles.

The writing is too sloppy to be legible, but next to the scrawled notes is a sort of diagram. Someone has drawn multiple round shapes, like bubbles or balloons, some longer and pinched-looking, some squat and full. Some of the balloons are touching, and others are far apart, the space between them shaded in with black ink. It’s bizarre but compelling.

letter###You unfold the letter and begin to read.

“...The value of Professor Hugh’s research, to us and to the war effort, is not to be understated. With that in mind, if he appears neglectful in his responsibility to his servants and to the children in his care, you will not mention it. Likewise, you will not mention last month’s regrettable accident to Hugh or anyone else you meet in Greenridge. Though I recognize it is difficult to be unemotional where children are concerned, the future of our empire may rest on the work we conduct with the Professor’s assistance. We cannot allow the loss of one orphan boy to shake our resolve. After all, when this war is won, we will use our new-discovered strength to bring the light of civilization to all the orphans of the world..."

stack of notes###You struggle to decipher the writing, which is not only messy, but also full of symbols you don’t recognize. If you had to guess, you’d say they were calculations.
