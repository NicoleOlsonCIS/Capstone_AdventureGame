The sight that greets you is everything you’ve dreamed of. Books...more books than you’ve seen in your life. More than you knew existed. Books from floor to ceiling, smothering the shelves, heaped on armchairs, strewn across tables that smell like wood and smoke. The luxury of it almost makes you dizzy.
There is an archway to the west.
