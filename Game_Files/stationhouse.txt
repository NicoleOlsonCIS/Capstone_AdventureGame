The rickety station-house door is unlocked and offers no resistance. You step inside.
The station-house has seen better days, but you can imagine it was charming once, before it
acquired a permanently damp, neglected appearance. Itâ€™s deserted, and empty except for a few
benches and a ticket counter. The door to the platform lies east.
