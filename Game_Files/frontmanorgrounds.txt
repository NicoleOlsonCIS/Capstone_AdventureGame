You make haste towards the House. The grounds seem to unfurl before you, vast and wild and covered in oak and ash trees. A wide path leads north to the front door of the House. A narrow path leads northwest around the side of the House, its destination hidden by an impenetrable cluster of trees. To the south are the fields, now almost entirely obscured by the mist.

She looks frail and gray, but her bony frame seems to possess a kind of wiry strength. She stands ramrod straight, and her heavy black dress - buttoned long at the wrists and high at the neck - is spotless.
