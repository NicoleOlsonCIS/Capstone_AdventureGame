The door to the south swings shut with a final, resonating boom, and you hear Maude hurrying to lock it. Taking a moment to get your bearings, you see that youâ€™re in an elegant, albeit gloomy, foyer. Heavy velvet curtains cover the windows, and the chandelier hanging from the ceiling provides only a weak glow. A polished staircase leads up to the second floor. To the north is an unlit hallway. To the west is a wooden door.
