The door to the south swings shut with a final, resonating boom, and you hear Maude hurrying to lock it. Taking a moment to get your bearings, you see that you’re in an elegant, albeit gloomy, foyer. Heavy velvet curtains cover the windows, and the chandelier hanging from the ceiling provides only a weak glow. A polished staircase leads up to the second floor. To the north is an unlit hallway. To the west is a wooden door.

It trails away into the gloom of the House.###No night

You pull the drapes open to find that the windows are blocked by heavy iron bars. You don’t see any means of opening them; you’re not sure they can be opened at all. You can only stare at the world outside like a prisoner in a cell. Through the windows, you see nothing but a stormy, fog-shrouded night.###As you squint into the night, you think you see something - a streak of movement in the mist, a dark shape - out of the corner of your eye. But when you blink and look again, it's gone.

What are they meant to keep out, you wonder? In any case, they won't budge.###No night

The black drapes extend from floor to ceiling, giving the room an oddly muffled, muted quality.###No night

An ornate wrought-iron chandelier. Its dim light is swallowed up by the oppressive opulence of the room.###No night

It's a bit grand for your liking. Feeling suddenly small and cold, you find yourself missing home.###No night
