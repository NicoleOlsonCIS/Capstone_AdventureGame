When you shake yourself out of your musing long enough to look around, you see that you’re passing through thick fields, full of damp grass that brushes against your knees with a soft shhhh. Maude walks determinedly ahead of you. The fields stretch out wide in almost every direction, but you think the train station lies southwest of here, and to the north, you see a manor house on a low slope dotted with trees. Heavy clouds start to darken the sky. 
***
You stand in a wide field, surrounded by knee-high grass that extends almost as far as you can see in most directions. The train station lies southwest of here. You can see the House to the north.

You stand in a tall, whispering field. The gloom of night begins to settle around you, limiting your vision. What lurks out here in the darkness, you wonder? You hear a distant rumble of thunder and realize you don't want to find out. The safety of the House lies north. 
***
You stand alone and shivering in an empty field. The thunder sounds closer than it was before. There again is that thick, choking white mist, slowly engulfing the fields. Though it's too dark to see, you're quite sure the House is to the north. 
***
It's too dark to see here. Best get back to the House.

You lean down and dig roughly with your fingers, wondering if you'll unearth something.###No night

Its sightless blue eyes gaze sadly at nothing in particular, and its red lips are fixed in a bland, accepting smile. The golden curls and white ruffled dress are matted with mud. It’s lost its shoes.###No night
