When you shake yourself out of your musing and look around, you see that you’re passing through fields full of damp grass that brushes against your knees with a soft shhhh. The fields stretch out in every direction, but you think the train station is southwest of here, and to the north, you see a manor house on a slope dotted with trees. Clouds darken the sky.

You stand in a wide field, surrounded by knee-high grass that extends almost as far as you can see in most directions. The train station lies southwest of here. You can see the House to the north.

You stand in a tall, whispering field. The gloom of night begins to settle around you, limiting your vision. What lurks out here in the darkness, you wonder? You hear a distant rumble of thunder and realize you don't want to find out. The safety of the House lies north.

You stand alone and shivering in an empty field. The thunder sounds closer than it was before. There again is that thick, choking white mist, slowly engulfing the fields. Though it's too dark to see, you're quite sure the House is to the north. 
***
It's too dark to see here. Best get back to the House.

If you got caught in it, you wouldn’t be able to see your own hand in front of your face.###Maude warned you not to get lost in it.

The grass ripples under a sudden light gust of wind. You glance down at the soil under your feet.###The grass ripples under a sudden light gust of wind. You glance down at the soil under your feet.

Its sightless blue eyes gaze sadly at nothing in particular, and its red lips are fixed in a bland, accepting smile. The golden curls and white ruffled dress are matted with mud. It’s lost its shoes.###Its sightless blue eyes gaze sadly at nothing in particular.
