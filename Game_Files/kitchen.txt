You follow your nose into a large, tidy kitchen, where something in the oven is making the most delicious smell. A stout, dour-looking cook labors over a floured countertop, while a flustered maid scurries to and fro, fetching and carrying. No one pays attention to you, except for the occasional disapproving glance. 
There's an open doorway to the west.
