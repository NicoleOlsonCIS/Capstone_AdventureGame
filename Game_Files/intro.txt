Mother insists you’re to be evacuated to the country, and doesn’t leave it alone until you promise you’ll go. You don’t want to. You can’t bear the thought of her wasting away alone in a city fated to become rubble. But there’s no arguing with Mother once her mind’s made up.

On the train platform, she holds you close for the last time in a long while. You breathe in her scent, warm and powdery and clean, and fix the memory of her in your mind as best you can. It’s this memory, already fading as you let her go and turn away, that gives you the strength to board the train.

You find an empty compartment and settle in. You and Mother agreed not to wave as the train pulls away - it’d be too painful for you both. Still, as the train judders to life, you look for her in the sea of tearful faces. She’s already gone. Though you didn’t think you’d cry, you do, until, too exhausted to do anything else, you let the motion of the train lull you to sleep.

Start of Day 1

You awake to a changed landscape. Everything outside the window is green as far as the eye can see, the land vibrant and almost lurid against the brooding light of a stormy sky. Your stomach shifts uncertainly as the train slows to a crawl, then stops at a deserted station.

You watch as the train disappears into the distance. The silence it leaves behind is palpable and cold. With a small sigh, you turn around and notice a woman waiting on the platform. You blink. Has she been there this whole time?
