bedroom:::#It's very rude to linger in someone's room when they're trying to sleep, you know.#

library:::#“My parents died when I was small,”#^Mina explains matter-of-factly.|||#“Uncle and I don’t have any other living family. It’s just him and the House, and me and Maude and the servants. I’m his heir - that’s why he tolerates me."#
***
library:::#“I look out my window every night, trying to see what’s out there in the storms. Sometimes I think I see things, horrible shapes, moving in the mist - but I don’t know if they’re really there. I must be going mad from being locked inside all the time."#
***
library:::#“A little boy used to live here, you know. His name was James. I doted on him, the poor motherless child. He was too curious for his own good...One day, there was this awful storm, and that cursed mist wrapping everything up in white… I was sure he was somewhere in the House, just hiding to play a trick on me...but he'd filched a key and gotten outside. I never saw him again."#^She swipes away a tear, hoping you haven't noticed.

library:::#"Here’s what I've figured out - well, what my pen pal Dworkin and I figured out. He's very important - he used to work at the Greenridge lab. Anyway, with Uncle’s help, the people at the lab are opening doors - hatches, they’re called - into the spaces between dimensions. Every time they open one, the mist rolls in, and there’s a storm. They don’t know how to predict where the hatch will appear, or for how long. Uncle’s the only person who understands how any of it works. We think he’s working on opening a permanent hatch somewhere, to try to talk to whatever’s out there, mad as that sounds. Only, we don’t know where."#

study:::#"Jiminy cricket!"#^Mina says in a hushed, excited whisper.|||#"You found a way into my uncle's secret study? No one's allowed in here. Quick - let’s see what we can find, before he finds out we’re here."#

study:::#“We have to stop Uncle, no matter what. The things he’s letting into our world - even if they’d help win the war - they’re evil, and they hurt people. Men like my uncle shouldn’t have these things. No one should have these things."#
***
study:::#“I do love my uncle, you know. I mean, I hate him because he’s cold and mean, and he doesn’t care what happens to anyone else as long as he gets what he wants. He hasn’t said a kind word to me in my life. But...I love him. I just do. I think if I could choose not to, I would - but that’s just the problem. I don’t have a choice."#

study:::#"What we've done...it's for the best, isn't it?"#

study:::#"It'd be nice to go outside for a change, wouldn't it? Usually the door's locked, but it's worth a try, surely."#
