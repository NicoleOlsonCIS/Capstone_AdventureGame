“...78, to West Hill Psychiatric Hospital early Thursday morning after taking him into custody Wednesday night. Dworkin had broken into a residence on Meadow Lane, authorities said, and was shouting at the terrified inhabitants when police arrived around midnight. 

‘He scared the daylights out of us,’ said Ken Cecil, the owner of the residence. ‘He was babbling about “them,” only he wouldn’t say who “they” were, and he kept saying, “The children! Don’t let them take the children!” We didn’t know what to make of it, but I feel for the man. The war affects all of us in different ways, and it must be hard living alone at that age. We’re just glad he didn’t do anything to hurt himself.’

Until the Meadow Lane incident, neighbors knew Dworkin as a quiet, polite man who kept to himself and worked as a janitor at Greenridge National Laboratory...”

“...of Greenridge Mysteries, the Gazette-exclusive series of features on local history and unsolved town mysteries old and new. This week, the spotlight falls on the empty field near the woods on the outskirts of Greenridge.

Known locally as Felton’s Field, the unused stretch of grass is famed for the mysterious circle of stones that stands there. Believed to have been erected by prehistoric peoples who lived in the region millennia ago, the stones are both a tourist attraction and a source of local controversy. The controversy boils down to this: just how many stones are there in the circle?

‘Seven! It’s seven, and that’s the last I’ll hear of it,’ said Elizabeth Reed, longtime librarian of Greenridge Public Library. ‘I walked by that field every day when I was young, and there were always seven stones - no more, no less. Really, of all things to argue about during these times! We ought to be coming together as a community to help the war effort.’

Greenridge High School student Jane Brown insists there are not seven, but eight, stones. ‘The funny thing is the first time I looked, last year, I saw seven,’ Brown said, ‘but I’ve checked every month since then, and it’s always been eight, so probably I didn’t count right the first time.’”

“‘...barking and snarling like mad, and bolted out into the storm. I’d never seen him do anything like that before,’ said Margaret Evans, the owner of the missing dog. ‘I called and called, but he didn’t come back inside, and it was pouring. I couldn’t find him anywhere the next morning, and that’s how I knew something was wrong. Baird would never miss his breakfast.’

Anyone with information that could lead to Baird’s safe return home are encouraged to contact either the Evans residence or the Greenridge police. In the meantime, owners of pets are urged to keep their animals inside, especially during the kind of inclement weather that has grown increasingly common in the County this year…”
