You open the door and let yourself into a prim bedroom with a neatly made bed, a wooden wardrobe, and a small writing desk. A trunk sits at the foot of the bed. The heavy blue drapes are open, and daylight streams into the room between the iron window bars. No one’s here. To the east is a wooden door.

You stand in a dark bedroom. You can make out the dim shapes of a bed, a wardrobe, a writing desk, and a trunk. There is a door to the east.

It's getting too dark to see much, and you don't want a scolding for being out of bed. Best head back to your room.

You settle down to look through the papers. One in particular catches your eye:
It's a charcoal portrait of an old man. You know instantly that it’s a good likeness of him - better than a good likeness. It’s like looking at the man himself. The lines trace a suggestion of mournful eyes and a weary smile. You feel - suddenly, intensely - that this man is alive, wherever he is. Whoever he is.
