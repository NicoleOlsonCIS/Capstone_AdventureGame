You hear eager footsteps patter down the hall and into the room.
***
Mina elbows you, interrupting your thoughts. “Does that seem natural to you?” She points toward the bookshelves.
***
You look at the shelves. There, floating in the air before them, is a silvery bubble.
***
A gray-haired, bespectacled man enters the room, walking with slow, deliberate, awful steps. 
***
Mina tenses beside you. “Oh, no,” she murmurs under her breath.
***
The Professor stops in front of Mina, his jaw clenching and unclenching. Without warning, he slaps her hard across the face, sending her tumbling to the floor.
***
“Meddling bitch,” he snarls. “I should have left you to rot in an orphanage after my useless sister whelped you and died.” He rounds on you. “As for you, you disgusting urchin, I doubt anyone will miss you after I - ”
***
“Uncle,” Mina interrupts, one hand over her throbbing cheek, the other gesturing frantically at the orb. “Uncle, look.”
***
He sees the silvery orb then. His eyes widen. “I’ve done it,” he breathes, falling to his knees. He seems to forget you’re here. “I knew...all along, I knew it must be possible…” He stares hungrily at it, transfixed, as if it were speaking to him, whispering something only he can hear.
***
“Yes,” he breathes. “Yes.” Above him, the silver orb shudders, contracts, expands again. You hear the shriek of an unearthly wind.
***
Mina tugs on your sleeve, then points at the marble bust on the shelf. You blink. Did its lips...move? You stare at the statue, at its lifeless marble mouth, which somehow stirs and shapes itself into an O...out of which emerges a tongue - no, a tendril. A fleshy, barbed tendril that stretches and stretches and stretches out of the mouth like a living vine, questing sightlessly about the room. It finds the Professor. Amid the howling wind, you hear a chorus like a thousand tortured dogs and men, and you feel something rupture in your ears and begin to bleed, hot rivulets running down the sides of your face. And through it all...something else.
***
An undulating keen, tuneless and yet somehow exquisitely musical. A high-pitched tremolo, so tentative that you’re sure it’ll be lost to you if you stop listening for even a moment. It sounds not in your ears but in your head, soothing your hurts, promising everything - everything you’ve wanted, everything you’ve wanted for everyone you love - and it is sweeter and softer than any lullaby Mother ever sang.
***
“Do you hear that?” the Professor sighs. Wrapped in the coils of the tendril, its barbed hooks sinking deep into his flesh, he turns his head to face you, his eyes black and unseeing. “The song of the spheres.”
***
He screams then. The coils pull tight, strangling, flaying, dragging him across the floor. They bring him face to face with the orb. He stares into it with dark, bleeding eyes, and whatever he perceives in the nothingness, it tranquilizes him, leaving him limp as a fish. The orb convulses, stretches, and with a series of gulps, swallows him whole.
***
The quicksilver sings to you, louder than before. You feel your body take one step of its own accord, then another, toward the glutted, keening orb.
***
Beside you, Mina takes a step toward the orb, and another, as if in a trance. You know you must destroy it, and you hate yourself because what you feel isn’t fear or horror, but sadness. Loss.
***
When you open your eyes, it takes you a moment to remember where you are. You sit bolt upright, frantically scanning for signs of the orb, the Professor, or the horrid thing that came out of the statue. You see nothing - only Mina, sitting and crying quietly in her uncle’s armchair.
***
You heave open the great front door of the House. For the first time since you arrived here, it’s a brilliant, cloudless day. It occurs to you that there may be another orb, another professor, one day soon. And the war rages on. You feel sorrow over it. You miss Mother.
***
Still, here you are. Your newfound friend sits beside you, smiling a small, brave smile. And the sunlight warms your cheek.
